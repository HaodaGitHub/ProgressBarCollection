We create this application to show up demonstration of some style of progress bars that are common used

This application are written by Qt QML language

We just use some basic controls of QML type so that it can run on many version of Qt 5. Some controls are used such as: Item, Rectangle, Timer, Text, Canvas, Repeater

Future work: add more style of progress bars

Additionally, we also support to measure FPS, CPU usage, RAM usage
